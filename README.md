## 🖋️ The Curio (curio.lightblog.dev)

Welcome to The Curio!

The Curio is an open dictionary similar to Urban Dictionary. The Curio focuses on wholesome, lighthearted, and fun wordplay.  

The intentionally minimal design is designed to highlight individual words and their definitions (and also because CSS is hard).

## 🔍 Why?

I really like website concepts such as [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com), but the content that I enjoy reading the most is on sites such as [ThisWebsiteWillSelfDestruct](https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com). I decided to make The Curio as a bridge between the two, a collection of user-submitted words with little to no interaction that also facilitates a wholesome and honest message.

## 🔩 TODO

> Features are minimal right now, but I plan on adding more as I find the time.

- [ ] 🤸 Working random document feature

- [ ] 🧹 Clean up client-side code

- [ ] 🦾 Make site more accesible + improve mobile view

- [X] 🚨 Improve backend security

## 🛠️ Contributing
